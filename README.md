# OmniAuth Pinterest

This gem contains the [OmniAuth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/) strategy for authenticating to [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/).

## Preparation

1. Register and sign into the [Pinterest developer center](https://developers.pinterest.com/)
2. Create an [application](https://developers.pinterest.com/apps/) and note the **App ID** and the **App secret**
3. Make sure that you have already installed [OmniAuth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/wiki) into your application. Otherwise check out the [installation details](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) and the [documentation](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/wiki).

## Installation

Add this gem to your application's ```Gemfile```:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-pinterest2'
```

Execute the ```bundle``` command to install the gem.

Next, tell OmniAuth about the Pinterest provider. For a Ruby on Rails application, your ```config/initializers/omniauth.rb``` file should look like:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :pinterest, ENV['PINTEREST_APP_ID'], ENV['PINTEREST_APP_SECRET'], scope: 'read_public, write_public', redirect_uri: "https://mysite.com/auth/pinterest/callback"
end
```

After restarting your application, point the authenticating user to ```/auth/pinterest```, the rest will be handled by OmniAuth.

## Authentication hash

Here's an example authentication hash available in ```request.env['omniauth.auth']```:

```ruby
{
  :provider => 'pinterest',
  :uid => '1234',
  :info => {
    :id => "1234",
    :url => "https://www.pinterest.com/jane_doe/",
    :first_name => "Jane",
    :last_name => "Doe"
  }
}
```
